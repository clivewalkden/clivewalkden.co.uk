Been using this class now for my sites for a while it's just the ticket. So I thought I'd include it here so that more people can benefit from it. I wish I could take the credit for producing this, but unfortunately it was built by Eric Sizemore over at <a href="http://www.secondversion.com" target="_blank" rel="external" title="Second Version">www.secondversion.com</a> he's also produced a handy tool or tracking your domains. Well worth a visit.

I couldn't find the files on his site, so I've included the file here for download (Download link is no longer available).
