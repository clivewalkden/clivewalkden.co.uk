Been using this class now for my sites for a while it's just the ticket. So i thought i'd include it here so that more people can benefit from it. I wish i could take the credit for producing this but unfortunately it was built by Eric Sizemore over at <a href="http://www.secondversion.com" target="_blank" title="Second Version">www.secondversion.com</a> he's also produced a handy tool or tracking your domains. Well worth a visit.

I couldn't find the files on his site so i've included the file <a href="http://blog.cwenterprises.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/mysql-class1.txt" title="here for download">here for download</a>.
