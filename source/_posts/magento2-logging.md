$logger->addWriter($writer);
$logger->info('Your text message');
```

### Magento 2.4.2

For Magento 2.4.2, adapt the following code to ensure effective logging:

$logger = new  \Laminas\Log\Logger();
$logger->addWriter($writer);
$logger->info('Your text message');
```

$writer = new \Zend_Log_Writer_Stream(BP . '/var/log/yourlog.log');
$logger = new \Zend_Log();
$logger->addWriter($writer);
$logger->info('Your text message');
```
