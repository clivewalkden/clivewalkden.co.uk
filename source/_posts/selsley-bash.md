Last weekend we finally got to try out our Bajas on Selsley common. The weather started well but turned bad, luckily by that time only one of the Bajas was still working. Mine only worked for about 5 minutes, later diagnosed as a faulty spark plug, Wol managed to break a front shock and screw his diff after somehow managing to pop out a dogbone. See the video below.
