<a href="http://www.emailology.org/#1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Emailology - The Science of Looking Good in the Inbox</a>.

The site also contains faq about common email clients for individual styling or tips. You can also view a standards guide to see which tag and attributes are supported to get the most out of your campaign.
