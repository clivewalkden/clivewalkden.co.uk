I've been experimenting with composer for a while now on Mac and PC and have found that even though I&#39;ve setup my Mac to alias composer to the /usr/bin/composer.phar file, when I have to update the composer.phar I still need to run `sudo /usr/bin/composer.phar` for the file to update correctly.

Is this something that anybody else has come across? If so how do you fix it?
