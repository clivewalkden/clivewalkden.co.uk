PHP is my primary development language and has been so for the last 11+ years. Being a PHP developer has meant I can work on a massive variety of projects and in my time I've seen lots of different frameworks come and go. The power of PHP is the ingenuity and dedication of it developers, this is what I love and hope to give some help with my knowledge in this blog.
