Tivoli Wines is an online and retail wine store based in the picturesque regency town of Cheltenham on the edge of the Cotswold hills. There's been a wine shop at 56 Andover Road since the 1980s, and our Tina has been here most of that time. It became Tivoli Wines in 2010 before David and Helen Dodd took over in 2016.

David has worked as a corporate property strategy advisor for nearly twenty years, and knew he'd found something special when he first visited Tivoli Wines in mid 2016. His wife Helen is the business's accountant (and, therefore, the boss...), as well as for a Cheltenham marketing agency.
