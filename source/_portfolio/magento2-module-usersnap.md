A plugin for Magento 2 that outputs the Usersnap JavaScript code into the website so that your users can report any issues they see while using your site.

The module has the functionality to output on the front end or back end of your Magento store. It also has IP restriction control to allow the module to run all the time and restrict access only to those users that you want to submit feedback.

The latest v2.0 release has been updated to use the latest Usersnap JavaScript code and includes the option of passing user data, disabling localStorage, disabling Google Fonts and disabling GeoIP location tracking.
