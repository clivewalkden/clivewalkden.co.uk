We were tasked with updating the design of the site and to upgrade to Hyvä Themes to improve the overall performance of the site.

The project involved a platform upgrade for Magento, a new theme, and a extensive update to modules to support the new Hyvä Theme. It was great to utilise AlpineJS and TailwindCSS to create a fast and responsive site.
