WatchGecko was founded in 2010 with a mission to provide a contemporary range of better quality watch straps to consumer and wholesale markets. Since then they have also developed several brand names, StrapJunkie and ZULUDIVER to satisfy increasing customer demand.

We advised the client that Magento would be the ideal solution for them. With Magento's flexibility and leading ecommerce platform we were able to produce a beautiful looking site while giving the client all the extra reporting and product information that they needed.
