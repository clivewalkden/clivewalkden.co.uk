Janes Pantry is a local family run bakery in Gloucestershire. They also provide fresh Buffet services, Celebration Cakes and Wholesale Bakery.

The site focuses on the Buffet and Celebration Cake sales and has undergone much since it&#39;s launch in 2010? The site has several bespoke jQuery scripts to handle the purchasing of the Buffets and Cakes.

The most recent addition has been the Custom Celebration Cake gallery which pulls in the photos and likes from Facebook and displays them on the site.
