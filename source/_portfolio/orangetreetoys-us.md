Orange Tree Toys asked SOZO to add an additional territory to the existing Magento 1 website and to offer a quote system only on the new US store.

We found a solution that fitted the clients requirements, including emailing the quotes to a local handler to organise shipping the products as well as a method of detecting the originators location and switching to the correct region automatically.
