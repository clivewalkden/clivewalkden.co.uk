UberRC offer RC owners the very best in custom components to make the most of their beloved car's. Be it protecting their investment from dirt and muck with our custom designed windows or shock socks to complementing their RC with the strength and lightness of Carbon Fibre products.

UberRC needed a complete CMS and Ecommerce system built that allowed them to control stock levels and pre-orders. This was accomplished with a bespoke CMS using PHP and MySQL.
