Orange Tree Toys was first established in 2000, and is run by two sisters, Anuja Wilson and Lamani Simons. All their products are designed here in the UK by Anuja, the Creative Director, who is constantly looking for inspiration for exciting products.

We advised the client that Magento would be the ideal solution for them. With Magento's flexibility and leading ecommerce platform, we were able to produce a beautiful looking site while giving the client all the wholesale specific solutions they needed.
