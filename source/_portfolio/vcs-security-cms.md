VSC Security provide high calibre security consultancy and protective services that are ethically delivered and enable your business to work successfully in challenging geopolitical environments.

The website is built with PHP, MySQL and SASS and is fully responsive. The front end and responsive development was built by <a href="https://snook.studio/" target="_blank" rel="external">Matt Snook</a> and I built the CMS to the clients specific brief.
