McCarthy Marland is based in Bristol city centre and have been serving Bristol and the South West since 2001.&nbsp;Their central location, highly experienced team and cutting edge waste segregation technology truly set them apart from their peers.

The website is built with PHP, MySQL and is fully responsive. The front end and responsive development was built by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mark-plunkett.co.uk" target="_blank">Mark Plunkett</a> and I built the CMS to the clients specific brief.
